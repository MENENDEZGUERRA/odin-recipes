        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taster</li>
        <li>8 oz (about 225g) fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and black pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and add a splash of oil. Sear the chicken breasts for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden brown. The chicken doesn't need to be fully cooked at this stage.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is searing, cook the fettuccine pasta according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, warm the heavy cream over medium heat. Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and garlic powder. Continue stirring until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li>Place the seared chicken breasts in a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Pour the Alfredo sauce over the chicken, making sure to coat them evenly.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the chicken and sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is baking, mix dried parsley with a pinch of salt and set aside.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is out of the oven, sprinkle the parsley mixture over the top for added flavor and a pop of color.</li>

        <p>Your Cheesy Baked Chicken Alfredo is now ready to be served. The combination of succulent chicken, creamy Alfredo sauce, and melted cheese creates a heavenly bite.
